# StringsOperations
some very simple tests about strings
used Visual Studio Express 2013

- Write a function to remove all trailing blanks from the right end of a string.
- Write a function to add extra blanks to the right end of a string to make it at least length n.
If the string is already n characters or longer, do not change the string.
- Write a function to center a string by adding blanks to the front and back.
If the string is already n characters or longer, do not change the string.
If an odd number of blanks have to be added, put the extra blank on the right.
You can use the functions in the previous problems(padRight and padLeft) to solve this problem.
- Write a function which capitalizes the first letter in every word.
Assume the first letter is any letter at the beginning or preceded by a blank.
All other letters should be turned into lowercase.You can use the library toupper and tolower functions.
- Write a function, reverse, which reverses the characters in the argument.Assume the prototype is
- Write a function, count, which counts the occurrences in the first argument, a, of the single character which is the second argument, c.
- Write a function, count, which counts the occurrences in the first argument, a, of the characters in the second argument, b.
- Write a function, deleteChar, which deletes any occurrence in the first argument, a, 
of the single character which is the second argument, c.
